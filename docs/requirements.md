# Requirement-to-test traceability

IDs are stable. Test paths/names are implementation targets; they have not been run against a system.

| CAUS-001 | Strategy views expose only available events | `test_future_perturbation` | M1-02 |
| CAUS-002 | Same-time cross-symbol decisions do not depend on input file order | `test_event_order`; F05 | M1-02 |
| CAUS-003 | New entry uses an eligible subsequent open | F01, F10 | M2-01 |
| CAUS-004 | Stop changes cannot apply inside the completed bar | F07 | M2-01 |
| EXEC-001 | Ambiguous bar uses stop-first; gap stop uses open | F02, F03, F12 | M2-01 |

| ACCT-001 | Cash/equity/P&L reconcile and fees apply once | F01, F08 | M2-01 |
| ACCT-002 | Reservations/sizing prevent overspend | F04, F05, F13, F14 | M2-01 |
| ACCT-003 | Account profile governs proceeds availability | F15; `test_unsettled_cash_unavailable` | M2-01 |

| STRAT-002 | VWAP follows the explicit state machine | VWAP-01 through VWAP-08 | M2-03 |
| EXP-001 | Every attempt has immutable inputs, status and outputs | `test_run_record`; rerun equivalence | M0-02, M2-04 |

## Future-perturbation harness

1. Build a multi-symbol synthetic stream with scanner changes, orders, open positions, feature warmup and session timers.
2. Choose a cutoff event key K, run the original stream, and collect all feature/ranking/proposal/order/ledger records with event keys <= K.
3. Create a second stream with the identical prefix through K. Change prices, volume, later availability, later universe records and later optional model outputs strictly after K. Preserve input validity.
4. Run again with the same configuration and seed. Assert byte-identical canonical records through K after excluding nondeterministic wall-clock/run-ID fields.
5. Repeat around range close, a same-time cross-symbol boundary and a stop-update boundary. Test late-arriving observations by availability, not merely the market time printed on a bar.
6. Separately permute input file order. After canonical ordering, the entire output must match. Add a deliberately leaky test double and verify that the harness catches it; do not ship the double as a strategy.
